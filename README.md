Task 1: Text Generation with GPT-2
GPT-2 is a pre-trained model that can generate human-like text based on the input it receives. By feeding it a prompt, GPT-2 uses its understanding of language patterns to continue writing sentences, paragraphs, or even entire stories. It works well for applications like chatbots, content creation, and language modeling
Task 2: Image Generation with Pre-trained Models
Pre-trained models like Stable Diffusion or GANs can create images from text descriptions or random noise. These models have already been trained on large datasets of images, so they can generate realistic or artistic images. Users can input a description, and the model will interpret that into a new image.
Task 3: Text Generation with Markov Chains
Markov Chains are used to generate text by predicting the next word in a sequence based on the previous word or words. Itâ€™s a simpler technique compared to deep learning models like GPT-2, but it's useful for basic text generation tasks like simulating writing style or creating random sentences.
Task 5: Neural Style Transfer
Neural Style Transfer is a technique that applies the style of one image (like the brushstrokes of a painting) to the content of another image (like a photograph). It uses deep learning to separate the content and style of images, allowing you to blend the artistic style of one with the structure of another, creating unique visuals.
